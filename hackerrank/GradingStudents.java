/*
HackerLand University has the following grading policy:

    Every student receives a 

in the inclusive range from to
.
Any
less than

    is a failing grade.

Sam is a professor at the university and likes to round each student's

according to these rules:

    If the difference between the 

and the next multiple of is less than , round up to the next multiple of
.
If the value of
is less than

    , no rounding occurs as the result will still be a failing grade.

Examples

round to
(85 - 84 is less than 3)
do not round (result is less than 40)

    do not round (60 - 57 is 3 or higher)

Given the initial value of
for each of Sam's

students, write code to automate the rounding process.

    Student 

received a , and the next multiple of from is . Since , the student's grade is rounded to
.
Student
received a , and the next multiple of from is . Since , the grade will not be modified and the student's final grade is
